Oh dear… the cross fell again.  
Life has its way of challenging us, doesn't it? Will you help me return it?

    ~ nun = true
    Bless you, child. Kindness still lives.
    -> DONE

+ "Isn’t this the third time it’s fallen?"
    Perhaps… but I like to believe everything happens for a reason.
    -> DONE

+ "Why do you bother putting it back?"
    Because we must keep trying. That’s what it means to believe.
