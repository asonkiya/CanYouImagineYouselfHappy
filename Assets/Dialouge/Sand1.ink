I tried making a castle with TWO towers!  
But I ran out of sand again. Will you bring some?

+ "I’m on it." 
    ~ sandcastle = true
    Thanks! This one’s gonna be huge!

+ "Don’t you ever get tired of rebuilding?"
    No. I like seeing what it turns into every time.
    -> DONE

    Rocks aren’t as fun. You can’t shape them.
